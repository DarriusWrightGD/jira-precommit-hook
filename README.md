jira-precommit-hook
-------------------

Goals:

- Distributable via npm (This will eventually be pushed to a public github repo)
- Testable
- Commit hook script contains the bare bones needed to call into this library.
  We may want to investigate use of existing
  [pre-commit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pre-commit) module.
